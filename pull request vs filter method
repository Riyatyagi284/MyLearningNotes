Pull Request:

Efficiency: If you have a large number of items to retrieve, using a pull request MORE EFFIECIENT than filtering, as it allows you to --> retrieve a specific subset of items without having to process all of them.
Complexity: PULL REQUEST > FILTER METHOD, --> as it requires you to set up a cursor and iterate over the results.
Use case: USEFUL for [paginating results] or for retrieving a specific subset of items based on certain conditions.

Filtering:

Efficiency: Filtering is generally more efficient than using a pull request for SMALL DATASET, --> as it allows you to apply filters directly to the query and retrieve only the relevant items.
Complexity: Filtering is simpler to implement than a pull request, as it does not require you to set up a cursor or iterate over the results.
Use case: Filtering is suitable for most use cases where you need to retrieve a subset of items based on specific criteria.

CONCLUSION :--
Dataset size: If you have a large dataset, use PULL REQUEST --> can be more efficient.
Complexity: If you are not familiar with MongoDB's cursor API, filtering may be simpler to implement.
Use case: Consider the specific criteria you need to filter on and whether a pull request would be more appropriate.
