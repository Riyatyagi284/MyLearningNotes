what are Robust APIS?

# [strong, flexible software]##
Ans:  -->  a flexible and strong API that allows applications to communicate with each other seamlessly.

## CHARACTERSTICS OF A ROBUST APIS: 
   --> Resilient: A robust API is able to adapt to changes in technology. 
   --> Reliable: A robust API is able to perform its functions consistently. 
   -->  Easy to use: A robust API is easy to use and control. 
   --> Uniform interface: A robust API uses the same format for requests and responses, and the same protocol. 
   --> Optimized for performance: A robust API is optimized for performance to deliver a good user experience. 

## TIPS FOR BUILDING A ROBUST APIS: 
   --> Define objectives 
   --> Consider security mechanisms like authentication and authorization 
   --> Use caching to reduce server load and improve response times 
   --> Use pagination for large datasets 
   --> Use compression techniques like GZIP to reduce data transfer size 
   --> Follow Postel's law: be conservative in what you send, and be liberal in what you accept
